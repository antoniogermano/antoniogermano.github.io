        Interviewer:
        Hello, Thamires, welcome. I'm Kate. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?
        Hi, Thamires, welcome to the interview. I'm Kate. Tell me a little about yourself.

        Thamires Peixoto (1,5 minutes):
        Hello, I'm Thamires. I've been in Ireland for four months to get better at English. I'm 33 and from Brazil. I
        studied Food Engineering at the Federal University of Grande Dourados. After college, my first job was as a
        teacher at a technical school, then I started working in the meat industry in the factory of Belo foods. I also
        did a master's degree on sustainable packaging. I went back to work in product development at my first job for
        two years, then moved to a bigger meat company for four years. After that, I worked at Unilever for one and a
        half years on rigid packaging. I've worked with many types of packaging and used different software. I've also
        worked on projects with marketing, suppliers and contractors.

        Interviewer:
        Talk about your career trajectory.
        Could you start by walking me through your professional background, focusing on your experience relevant to this
        Co-Packing Manager position within an R&D function?
        Can you share your professional history?
        What have you done professionally?
        How did you get to where you are?

        Thamires Peixoto (7 minutes):
        I have a degree in Food Engineering. I did research and internships during my studies, in juice and ice cream
        factories, and taught at a technical school called Senai. I worked in quality control in the meat industry, then
        did my master's in Food Science focusing on sustainable packaging. I went back to factory work, doing product
        research and development, handling regulations and industrial testing. I improved packaging and worked on animal
        products. I took an innovation course, then moved to a company called Brazil Foods to work on technical lists
        and packaging development. I traveled a lot, solved packaging problems, and worked with Christmas products. Then
        I moved to Unilever to work on hair care packaging. I worked less in factories but more with suppliers and
        marketing.

        Interviewer:
        Can you share a specific example of your research and development work, maybe in the food or dairy area?
        Can you discuss any direct experience you have in research and development, particularly within the food or
        dairy industry?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        My dairy experience was mostly with ice cream and milk analysis during internships. I know about dairy from my
        studies and technical course. Most of my experience is with meat products, working on packaging like flexible
        and rigid types, labels, and improving box quality.

        Interviewer:
        Can you share examples of projects you've managed, especially those involving external partners or contractors?
        What about projects you managed with outside companies or suppliers?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        At BRF, I worked with McDonald's and Burger King, meeting their standards. I also worked with external companies
        at Unilever, understanding their production lines for projects. I had to communicate well with suppliers to
        change packaging sizes or materials and work closely with them for product development.

        Interviewer:
        Can you talk about your experience in managing B2B relationships, particularly in a multi-cultural and
        international context?
        How about managing business relationships, especially internationally?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I worked with companies in Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia on packaging projects, ensuring product standards.
        Most of my international work was with packaging suppliers, focusing on meeting client standards and managing
        specifications.

        Interviewer:
        Can you provide an example of how you've contributed to strategic planning or expansion in previous roles? How
        do you approach identifying and executing growth opportunities?
        Can you tell me how you helped with company growth or planning?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        At BRF (Brazil Foods), I worked on Christmas products, improving testing times with new equipment. At Unilever,
        I was part of launching a new shampoo line, unifying packaging and working on cost reduction.

        Interviewer:
        Could you share a challenging situation you encountered in your career, particularly related to contract packing
        or production, and how you addressed it?
        Have you faced any big challenges, especially with contract packing or production?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        Starting in product development was challenging because I had to negotiate with production and conduct tests
        without a proper lab. I also had to train people and manage changes that could affect production.

        Interviewer:
        What is your understanding of the co-packing process, especially in the context of the dairy industry? How do
        you ensure quality and efficiency in such arrangements?
        What’s your understanding of co-packing, especially in dairy?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        Co-packing is when a company needs another to make their product. It requires clear communication on product
        requirements, limitations, and timelines. Regular meetings and project schedules are important for success.

        Interviewer:
        How do you stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in R&D, particularly in the dairy sector?
        How do you keep up with research and development innovations?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I use Mintel for innovation updates, scientific research tools, and stay informed through LinkedIn and packaging
        websites, especially on sustainability topics.

        Interviewer:
        Can you discuss a time when you successfully implemented a new technology or process that improved efficiency or
        product quality?
        Can you mention a time you implemented a new technology or process?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I mentioned developing equipment to test bags faster at BRF. I also worked on improving packaging efficiency and
        materials to prevent damage during shipping.

        Interviewer:
        This position is primarily remote but requires some travel to contract packing sites. How do you manage remote
        work effectively, and how flexible are you with travel?
        How do you manage remote work and travel flexibility?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        Remote work is like in-person work, following project stages closely. I'll be available for travel after my
        English course ends in May.

        Interviewer:
        Given the expansion plans of our partner business, where do you see yourself contributing most significantly in
        this role?
        Where do you see yourself adding value here, given our expansion plans?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I see myself in a leadership position, building a team for executing projects in different countries, focusing
        on project and people management, and seeking innovations in dairy packaging for environmental benefits.

        Interviewer:
        How do you plan to tackle the challenges of managing across different cultures and regulatory environments?
        How do you plan to handle different cultures and regulations?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        At Unilever, I learned to work with various regulations. It's important to have a regulatory team informed about
        each country's rules to manage risks and keep projects on track.

        Interviewer:
        - What are your biggest strengths?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I adapt well to different situations, communicate easily, and always look for process improvements. I am
        enthusiastic, proactive and creative. I focus on innovation and sustainability.

        Interviewer:
        What are your biggest weaknesses?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I'm very focused on doing things, which can make me anxious for fast results. I manage this by organizing my
        time and work carefully.

        Interviewer:
        Now, Jen, do you have any questions for us about the role, the company, or anything else you’d like to discuss?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        Can you tell me the name of the client?
        If I get the job, when would I start working?
        Am I getting a team? How many people are working on the team?

        Interviewer:
        Why do you want to work for us?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I believe this is a great opportunity for growth, and my experience is perfect for the role.

        Interviewer:
        Why did you leave your previous role/job/company?

        Thamires Peixoto:
        I was having difficulty dealing with the demands of the projects and with the conduct of the management team
        because the goals were unclear and they changed weekly. We didn’t have enough support and I was unhappy, so when
        I left the company I sought the exchange program that was an old dream to improve English and have better work
        opportunities, work in a company abroad
